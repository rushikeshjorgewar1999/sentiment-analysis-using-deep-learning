# sentiment-analysis-using-deep-learning

To run the above project code, you can follow these steps:

Install Required Libraries:
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

bash

Copy code

"pip install tensorflow scikit-learn"

Set Up Your Python Environment:
Create a new Python script or a Jupyter Notebook, and paste the provided code into it.

Replace Sample Data:
Replace the sample data (texts and labels) with your own dataset for sentiment analysis. Ensure that the texts list contains your sentences and the labels list contains corresponding sentiment labels.

Run the Code:
Execute the code in your Python environment. This will train the LSTM model on your data.

Model Saving:
The trained model will be saved as 'sentiment_analysis_model.h5' in the same directory as your script. You can adjust the model saving location if needed.

Evaluate and Use the Model (Optional):
You may want to evaluate the model's performance on a test set or use it for making predictions on new data. Adjust the code accordingly.
